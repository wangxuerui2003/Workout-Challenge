# Workout Challenge

---

This was an idea that popped up in my mind yesterday when I was jogging.
<br>
Doing sets of different movements are just not my taste of working out. I like to do challenges, I like to achieve certain amount of reps or km per day.
<br>
Years ago I do all the stuff with a pen and paper, I set up the challenge name, duration, and a grid to check everytime I finish today's challenge.
<br>
But you know us nerdy programmers, we hate pen and papers.
<br>
So this dummy app is born, done within one day. It's extremely poor designed and I promise it's gonna look like shit on a phone. No fancy frameworks neither nice documentation. All data are stored on your browser's localstorage.

Anyway, checkout this website on [Workout Challenge](https://workout-challenge.vercel.app/)
